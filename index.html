                <p>student at the Arab Open University (AOU), studying Computing with Business.
                    This major combines the technical aspects of computer science with key business 
                    principles, equipping students with skills in programming, software development,
                    data management, and business strategy. As part of my studies, I’m working on 
                    my graduation project, which involves creating a food ordering application 
                    designed to help people with chronic diseases like diabetes and high blood 
                    pressure. The app focuses on providing personalized food suggestions based 
                    on medical conditions, enabling users to enjoy meals more freely while prioritizing
                    their health. I’m passionate about leveraging technology to create meaningful 
                    solutions and make a positive impact. Alongside my studies, I maintain a structured
                    routine that helps me stay productive and connected with my family.</p>

                        <p>I studied high school in the first high school in Saudi Arabia in Riyadh.
                            I'd a great time with my colleagues and thought of how it was fun and meaningful 
                            for me, even it was not always that good and happy days.<br>
                            I have a lot of friends include Sarah, Dana, Leen, Zinap, Olla, Alla, Rawan and others.

                            I need to take, and in the next years I started to take more courses that was fun, 
                            meaningful and full of math problems, where I can say the fun starts. I'm learning about
                            two majors in the same time which is different from usual. I wish I do better in the
